<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

### Blacktown Bar

This repo represents a decentralized bar as a DAO in which all the transactions (buy drinks, play games, etc.) are registered in the blockchain. The bar uses its own ERC20 token to manage all the operations. As a DAO, proposals will be allowed.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started 

Work with this repo in the browser (optional)<br/>

It's recommended that you've gone through the [hardhat getting started documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) before proceeding here. 

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version`and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` And get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

### Installation

1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/eLSeR17/blacktown-bar
cd blacktown-bar
```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

or 

```
npm i 
```

3. Run the test suite (which also has all the functionality)

```
yarn hardhat test
```
or
```
npx hardhat test
```

If you want to deploy to a testnet:
4. Add a `.env` file with the same contents of `.env.example`, but replaced with your variables.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### On-Chain Governance Example

Here is the rundown of what the test suite does. 

1. We will deploy the ERC20 token "BlacktownToken" which we will use to control the bar.
2. We will deploy a Timelock contract that we will use to give a buffer between executing proposals.
   1. Note: **The timelock is the contract that will handle all the money, ownerships, etc**
3. We will deploy our Governence contract 
   1. Note: **The Governance contract is in charge of proposals and such, but the Timelock executes!**
4. We will deploy the bar's main contract, which will be owned by our governance process! (aka, our timelock contract).
5. We will propose a price to be changed in our bar contract.
6. We will then vote on that proposal.
7. We will then queue the proposal to be executed.
8. Then, we will execute it!


Additionally, you can do it all manually on your own local network like so:

1. Setup local blockchain 
```
yarn hardhat node
```

2. Propose a new value to be added to our Box contract

In a second terminal (leave your blockchain running)
```
yarn hardhat run scripts/propose.ts --network localhost
```

3. Vote on that proposal

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/vote.ts --network localhost
```

4. Queue & Execute proposal!

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/queue-and-execute.ts --network localhost
```


You can also use the [Openzeppelin contract wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#governor) to get other contracts to work with variations of this governance contract. 

### Off-Chain governance Example

> This sectoin is still being developed. 

Deploy your ERC20 and [make proposals in snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/create).
